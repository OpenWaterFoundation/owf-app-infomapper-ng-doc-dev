Multiple versions of standalone QGIS can be installed, including latest release and long term release.
Important naming conventions help development environment tools use the correct versions.

To install QGIS, follow instructions in the
[OWF / Learn QGIS](https://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-qgis/install-qgis/install-qgis/) documentation.

Additional installation steps, such as configuring the PyCharm virtual environment,
